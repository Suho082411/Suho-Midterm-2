		<h1> MY SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL DAYS </h1>
	<br><br><br>
	<p id="p3"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My Senior highschool life is the most astounding part of my existence so far, I found two of the best things life could possibly offer, and that's Passion and Love. The first that I'll elaborate why I choose the word Passion is that I found the motivation or drive to enhance my passions in life, and one thing is singing, I always love to sing my heart out, music always soothes my mind and it's the most remarkable thing that I would love to escalate and continue.
	The second one is Love, all my life I had never thought what would it be like if I found someone who I wanna give all my love to. I was growing as a troublesome kid and being in love had never came to my mind that time, not until now, after a short span of time meeting other people, no one really made me feel what love really is, as time goes by one of my close friend introduced me to a dating platform on facebook, as i scroll I've talked with a couple of people but none of them were really active and ending up with an unfinished conversation, as I kept on scrolling one girl caught my attention, her eyes were really beautiful and I immidietly liked her profile, after some time she liked me back and I was very excited to start a conversation with her. After a few chats I asked if I could have her Facebook name for us to continue the conversation via messenger and I was thrilled because she agreed. After a few days of chatting, we figured we played the same online game which is Moblie Legends, I always enjoyed playing with her and as time goes by day after day of spending a time with her, I realize that I'm starting to like her, at first i really don't know why I always feel happy whenever we spend time together and each day busy or not I can't seem to get her off my mind, after weeks of thinking my feelings through, I've come to a conclusion that I genuinely like her and really looking forward to get to know her more. After a month and 8 days, I've decided to take steps forward and ask her if I can court her, and I was really glad she said yes. As time goes by, my feelings for her had dug deeper and deeper without a specific reason, as I'm thinking it through I've realized that this is what they call Love, I was 101% sure that I'm falling for her, She was the very first person to ever made me feel like this, the feel of excitement and fear, the way she makes me laugh and makes me feel special and cared, she is simply a one of a kind lady who's worth everything. It really feels amazing to fall in love for the first time with I can tell the most amazing girl I've met. It's really beautiful to experience first love as a kind of love that's unexpected and develops naturally over time. I can proudly tell that out of 7.98 Billion People in the world, and yet she's the perfect girl for me. I'm in the phase of my life where in at the same time I'm focusing on my goals in life and falling in love each and everyday with the same person I've met in june. And I am very proud and thankful to God and the universe for leading me to her, for making my life better. I'm just a simple guy and yet the world still manages to give me blessings that I've been praying for, I'm genuinely happy and wouldn't ask for more but to be successful some time in the future as I"ll still love the same person who I love today.</p>
