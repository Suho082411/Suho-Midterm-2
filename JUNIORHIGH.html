		<h1> MY HIGH SCHOOL DAYS </h1>
	<br><br><br>
	<p id="p2"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My high school life started at 7th grade, This is where i started to learn about life outside my parent's supervision. I became more independent and learning how to deal with things on my own, my dad still sends me to school and fetch me afterwards, but then i learned that i can go to places outside my school on my own with my friends. Back then i was a troublemaker, i remembered putting a sticker on the Philippine flag and i got detention for that, i can't really tell how many troubles i had to make and i'm not saying im proud of it but it was part of me growing up. I joined basketball games in school and i discovered that i can sing, so i joined signing contest and battle of the bands, i then gained a lot of friends and life was really fun.
