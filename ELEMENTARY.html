		<h1> MY ELEMENTARY DAYS </h1>
		<br><br><br>
	<p id="p1"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I started my elementary life in Libas Merida, Leyte. I studied there for 7 years. I had a lot of friends growing up. Me and my cousins which are all boys lived by the neighborhood, we played a lot of games, especially PSP or Play Station Portable, we played a lot of games and it varies with what type of game it is, my special favourite is God Of War. Me and my niece who is 2 years younger than me go to the same school, we wusually go home together and she has a lot of friends too, i'm proud to say that in my elementary days i was a consistent honor student and that made my parents very proud of me, espcially my mom whose a teacher. At grade 6 i started playing and liking the sport basketball, i always played with my friends every after class. I fell in love with the sport and i constantly played it because it was my dad's sport also, he was a varsity player back when he was still in high school and college.  </p><br>
