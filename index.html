		<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
		<p id="p4"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I am a very adventurous and outging kid since then. My favourite hobbies are playing basketball, playing with radio control toys, watching movies and just basically a stay home kid. My childhood is pretty much amazing up until now where life gets sadder and sadder because maturity hits you and you understand everything, problems are always present and mental health issues kicks in, only a matter of time to get back up and find happiness, as i have found that happiness with my girlfriend, although life maybe a bit hard but it's great to have someone who keeps you going, giving you more reasons to live life as it should be.</p><br>

		<p id="p4"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp If I will be given a chance to go back to my old self, I woudn't change a thing, those happened and made me what i am now, and it's fine by me, it may be hard but can always see the bright side of it. </p>
